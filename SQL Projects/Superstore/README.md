# Superstore Project

This is the Superstore Project based on the **public dataset** Superstore.

The SQL dialect used in this project is PostgreSQL.

It has two components:

1. All the tables in the snowflake schema in .txt format that can be found on the "Model" folder.
2. The .sql file with the queries in the Queries folder.

In order to implement this you'll need to download the tables and relate them (if you want to).

After that you'll be able to run the queries on your environment by copy and paste.

Enjoy the study!
